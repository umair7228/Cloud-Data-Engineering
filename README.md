Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and managing systems and infrastructure that collect, store, and analyze large volumes of data. It involves creating data pipelines to ensure that data is clean, reliable, and accessible for analysis and decision-making. Data engineers work on integrating data from various sources, optimizing data workflows, and ensuring data quality and performance.
